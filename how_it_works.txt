Here is a quick summary on how "The ultimate battle works"

-> there are 2 dictonaries "attack_attack" and "defensive_attack" with 5 random keys and value pair. The when the player presses one
attack statigy, one key and one value is picked at random. key acts as damage and value acts as HP gain.


-> the 1st player to attack is choosen at random

-> if either of the player's HP falls below zero, a windows.alert() pop is through declaring the winner
