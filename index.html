    <hr>
    <p>= it is a simple fight game where there are 2 players.
    Each player has 50000 HP intially❤
    A random player will get the chance to attack first
    These are 2 modes of attack, attacking💥 and defensive✔
    attacking attacks deal more damage but provide lesser healing💥
    defensive attacks provide higher healing but cause lesser damages✔
    The one to reach the HP lower than zero looses😁

    <hr>
    <p>It is a simple 2 player race game. Each player gets to roll a dice. I may land in any number
    between 1 to 6. Both players start from zero and the one to reach 100 first wins the game 😁</p>
